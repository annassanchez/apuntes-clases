He is of Russian Jewish descent. At 17, he took his first step towards becoming a stand-up comedian when he spontaneously took the stage at a Boston comedy club. He found he was a natural comic. He nurtured his talent while at New York University (graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1991) by performing regularly in clubs and at universities. During his freshman year, he snagged a recurring role as the Huxtable family's friend Smitty on La hora de Bill Cosby (1984). While working at a comedy club in L.A., he was ""discovered"" by Dennis Miller, who recommended him to Saturday Night Live (1975) producer Lorne Michaels and told him that Sandler had a big talent. This led to his being cast in the show in 1990, which he also wrote for in addition to performing. After Saturday Night Live (1975), Sandler went on to the movies, starring in such hit comedies as Cabezas huecas (1994), Terminagolf (1996), Billy Madison (1995) and Un papá genial (1999). He has also starred in Mr. Deeds (2002) alongside Winona Ryder; Ocho noches locas (2002), an animated movie about the Jewish festival of Chanukah; and Embriagado de amor (2002). He also writes and produces many of his own films and has composed songs for several of them, including El chico ideal (1998). Sandler has had several of his songs placed on the ""Billboard"" charts, including the classic ""The Chanukah Song"".
